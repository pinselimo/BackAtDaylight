# BackAtDayLight - Garmin DataField

This tiny project provides a data field for Garmin devices showing at which minimum average speed the user has to proceed in order to reach their destination before sunset.

Especially during winter I find myself often calculating how much I need to stress about getting home at daylight. With this data field it's easy to keep track of just how much in a hurry I need to be.

## Prerequisites

In order to function the device needs to have a course set, such that it knows how far it is to your destination.
